
The program is split into three files. The newTask.h file holds the instructions
for individual tasks and the task lists including the classes that
represent the two entities. All functions that involve moving tasks
between queues and printing are there. Scheduler.h holds the class that calls and controls 
the tasks and tasks lists and how differents lists will interact with each other.  
The .cpp simply creates an object for the schedule class and runs its main function.
